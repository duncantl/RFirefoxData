Package: RFirefoxData
Version: 0.2-0
Title: Get data from Firefox browser
Description: This package aims to quere data from Firefox such as the open windows and tabs,
 bookmarks, the history of URLs visited, logins for accounts, file handler actions,
 extensions.
 Initially, it focuses on windows and tabs so that I can programmatically examine
 the large (> 500) tabs that I fequently have open and find when each tab was last
 viewed.
 This and the AutoClose extension I wrote tries to help me keep the number of tabs to a "reasonable" number.
